# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
A data science approach to predict and understand the applicantâ€™s profile to minimize the risk of future loan defaults.
The dataset contains information about Loan applicants. Banks, globally, use this kind of dataset and type of informative data to create models to help in deciding on who to accept/refuse for a loan.
After all the exploratory data analysis, cleansing and dealing with all the anomalies we might (will) find along the way, the patterns of a good/bad applicant will be exposed to be learned by machine learning models.
